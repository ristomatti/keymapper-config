# Keymapper config 

My [Keymapper](https://github.com/houmain/keymapper) config and assorted
scripts. This is meant for personal use but shared for anyone interested.

## TODO

- [ ] Install script to setup symbolic links
- [ ] Come up with a better structure for splitting the config
- [ ] Remove unused mappings and various experiments
- [ ] Improve documentation

## Notes

### Syntax higlighting

Languages usable for syntax highlighting of `keymapper.conf` (with remarks):

- starlark (best found so far)
- bash (works pretty well but breaks depending on the config, requires shellcheck ignore if installed)
- ini (works for basic highlighting)
