# Keymapper config 

My [Keymapper](https://github.com/houmain/keymapper) config and assorted
scripts. This is meant for personal use but shared for anyone interested.

## TODO

- [ ] Install script to setup symbolic links
- [ ] Come up with a better structure for splitting the config
- [ ] Remove unused mappings and various experiments
- [ ] Improve documentation
